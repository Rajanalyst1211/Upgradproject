The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent medical decision support system that analyzes patient data to assist doctors in making informed decisions about 
the best treatment options for individual patients. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, 
the system will provide personalized treatment recommendations based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, lab results, and other relevant factors.
